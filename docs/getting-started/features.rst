Key Features
============

.. _features:

Overview
--------

Mixer synchronizes in real time the modifications done to the scene and the objects it contains. During a collaboration session, Mixer displays the position of other participants and highlights their selections.

See :ref:`work-together` for more details.

.. _synchronized:

What is synchronized
--------------------

Most of the elements contained in a scene, the data types, are synchronized, as well as the custom properties of all datablocks.
The following table summarizes the covered features and a note indicates when synchronization is not available because the feature has not been implemented yet.

==============  ==================  ==============================================

.. [Convert]
    The result of object conversion (**Object**/**Convert to** menu) is not synchronized.

.. _update-delays:

.. [Delay]
    Some updates may be delayed until another modification is detected:

    * scene annotations: try to click around in the background of the 3D viewport
    * animation curves names : try to toggle the curve *Enable* checkbox twice.

.. [Edit]
    While an object is not in Object mode (in Edit, Sculpt, Paint, ...) the local modifications to this object are
    not sent to the other participants and the other participants modifications are not applied. Pending modifications
    are applied when the mode changes.

.. [GreasePencil]
    * the mask layer is not correctly synchronized
    * area fill is sometimes not correct

.. [Image]
    Generated images and UDIMs are not synchronized. Image files are synchronized.

.. [Library]
    Nested libraries will fail when shared folders are not in use. The following are not synchronized:

    * the results of **make local** and **reload**
    * library overrides

.. [Media] 
    Media files are synchronized. The result of **reload** or media path modification are not synchronized.

.. [NodeGroups]

   **Collection** sockets in geometry node groups cause synchronization failures and may crash


.. _not-synchronized:

What is NOT synchronized
------------------------

In order to provide to all participants a collaborative experience with as much freedom as they have during a solo session some features are deliberately not synchronized.
This is the case for most User Interface elements, user preferences and configuration.

=====================  =====================================================
UI and Settings          Comments
=====================  =====================================================
User preferences       
Key mapping            
Installed add-ons

Active tool             Eg: Move, Rotate, Scale...
3D cursor               
Scene display mode      Show gizmos, overlays...
Viewport shading        
Play mode               
=====================  =====================================================

=====================  =====================================================
Scene Properties       Comments
=====================  =====================================================
Scene current camera   See [SceneCurrentCamera]_
Render engine          See [RenderEngine]_
=====================  =====================================================

.. [SceneCurrentCamera] Although belonging to the scene properties, preventing the current camera to be synchronized allows each user to view and render the scene from the camera of her choice

.. [RenderEngine] Each user can render either with Eevee, Cycle or another avaiable engine of her choice

.. _caveats:

Caveats
-------

In addition to the limitations listed in the previous section, you should be aware of the following :

* using undo may cause unexpected behavior and cause crashes. Using undo while in **Object** mode may undo other participants changes.
* the files saved by all participants are :ref:`not exactly identical <saves-not-identical>`.
